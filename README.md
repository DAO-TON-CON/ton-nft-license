# NFT Ownership License in The Open Network

This document is an overview of the problems of determining the rights to  non-fungible token (__NFT__) in The Open Network, for the seller, the artist, the buyer. The article describes the trend of crypto art, which is digital art, which is considered as physical art because of the possibility to confirm the ownership of the work. The authenticity of digital art can be confirmed by using __NFT__ or a  non-fungible token. The possibilities and limitations of the development of the __NFT__-market in The Open Network are presented.

## The use of non-fungible tokens (NFT).

NFT - digital identifiers secure the confirmed ownership of virtual elements in the blockchain, protecting them from replication, making them identifiable and unique, increasing their value and opening up business opportunities. Non-fungible token can be used to sell digital collectibles. In addition, NFTs have the potential to transform the relationship between brands and customers, opening up exclusive opportunities. They can also be used as secure digital passports that guarantee the authenticity of goods, which makes them useful, in particular, for luxury goods retailers and consumers. For example, Swiss watchmaker Vacheron Constantin has launched Hour Club, an owner-only digital platform offering tracking and authentication of their watches with NFT support, customized content and event invitations. Despite the fact that the technology is mainly focused on consumer goods and mass media, its spread is accelerating.

## Using NFT digital tools in investment activities
Today, an NFT token is usually understood exclusively as digital art or crypt art, i.e. a certain object of copyright (music, text, picture). This is due to the fact that tokens allow you to create any media file. However, it is possible to tokenize not only copyright objects, but any other objects. So, in accordance with Liechtenstein legislation, an NFT token is a container program that is wrapped on the platform, transmitted using smart contracts, etc. Any object can be "sewn" into this "container" (an object of movable or immovable property, the same AI, or an object created by AI). The legal regime of what is "sewn" into the "container" is regulated by customary law.

Accordingly, the NFT token has two components: unique objects that are "sewn" in them, and the ability to use these objects. Thus, there is a bifurcation of the goals of the purchasers of this type of tokens. Some people collect them or buy them in order to sell them more expensive after some time. Others acquire them in order to use them. For example, on the exchanges of NFT tokens, tokens are used in which domain names or objects used in virtual worlds are "sewn". Accordingly, the acquirer of such tokens uses them to solve practical problems (marking certain objects, participating in a sports game or in the virtual world, hosting websites, etc.).

Thus, there is a convergence of technologies: first, a program is used to create an object of copyright, then a program for its tokenization, and then various options for using tokens are possible. In this regard, the legislation on digital financial assets cannot be extended to NFT tokens, since they do not perform the corresponding functions. Rather, such tokens can be used as a tool for the protection and commercial turnover of intellectual property objects. For example, a singer records a new song, "sews" it into a token and sells such a token through a special platform through the conclusion of a smart contract. In this regard, the main question today is whether it is possible to say that exclusive rights arise from NFT tokens, and whether the norms of current legislation apply to them, or whether new legal institutions need to be created to consolidate the legal status of rights that arise from the ownership of NFT tokens?

## Problem statement
One of the types of non-fungible token are NFT [2]. The occurrence of this object and transactions with it causes a lot of legal and accounting problems. In particular, along with the presence of an active market for such tokens, its legal status is not clear, business practices have not been formed in international practice, the process of their accounting and taxation has not been standardized. Based on the essential characteristics of the NFT, there is also a difficulty in classifying it as an accounting object and related accounting methodology. In order to outline ways to solve the problems that have arisen, it is necessary to consider the essence of NFT, their regulatory regulation and belonging to the objects of accounting fixed in the current international accounting standards.

## Main results
It is believed that the token is unique; it is almost impossible to fake, divide or replace it with another similar product. This approach involves securing certain rights to a digital object, although at the moment it is not entirely clear how these rights are regulated. This new and rather active trend in cyberspace is already changing the art and collectibles industry, and its application in the future may be the basis for the emergence of a new asset class. [3]

## Conclusions
Studying the standards concerning the NFT market of these objects in general and their legal and accounting norms. Now there is an active introduction of digitalization in all spheres of the economy, and the accounting methodology should change. But there is a significant lag behind the current practice, the availability of a market for new digital products. The relationships on computers, the emergence of new tools and technologies raise many questions that are not reflected in the accounting regulations. The market for non-interchangeable NFT tokens in cyberspace is actively developing.When transactions exceed significant volumes, regulatory legal regulation does not regulate them in accordance with the current situation of the information society. According to the results of the identification of the NFT as an accounting object, it was partially or completely impossible to attribute it to a specific object of accounting policy.
In order to ensure the accounting of such specific digital products as NFT and its regulation at the level of standards or in DAO smart contracts, it is necessary to develop a methodology for accounting for these information products.

# Standard
Biometric data exchange format standards define biometric data exchange records for different biometric modalities. The parties that have agreed in advance to exchange biometric data exchange records, as defined in the ISO/IEC STK 1/PC 37 biometric data exchange format standards, should be able to perform biometric recognition when using each other's data. The Parties should be able to carry out biometric recognition even if the specific standards of the biometric data exchange formats to be applied have not been agreed in advance, but their systems are based on the ISO/IEC STK 1/PC 37 biometric standards.

# Fungible, Non-Fungible, Semi-Fungible Tokens Smart Contracts

## NFT (Non-Fungible tokens) in `nft` folder

Basic implementation of smart contracts for NFT tokens and NFT collections in accordance with the [Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/62).

`nft-collection.fc` - basic implementation of immutable NFT collection with royalty.

`nft-collection-editable.fc` - basic implementation of the NFT collection with royalty in which the author can change the content and royalty params.

It is preferable to use an editable collection in case if you decide to change content hosting in the future (for example, to TON Storage).

`nft-item.fc` - basic implementation of immutable NFT item.

[TonWeb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb) JavaScript SDK 0.0.38+ supports these contracts. 

Also repo contains an example of a simple marketplace smart contract `nft-marketplace` and a smart contract for selling NFT for a fixed price for Toncoins `nft-sale`.

In a real product, marketplace and sale smart contracts are likely to be more sophisticated.

## Jettons (Fungible tokens) in `ft` folder

Basic implementation of smart contracts for Jetton wallet and Jetton minter in accordance with the [Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/74).

Contains an example of a simple ICO smart contract.

## Semi-Fungible

Semi-Fungible tokens is combination of NFT and FT.

## Explanations
<a name="1">1</a>: **Artifact** (neologism, from Latin. ars — art + lat. factus — made, i.e. "made according to the laws of art") is a product of human creative activity.

<a name="2">2</a>: **A non-fungible token** is a certificate of uniqueness of a digital object - a digital cryptographic certificate that confirms the right to own a digital asset (digital artifact, file). The use of __NFT__ does not prevent the possibility of copying a digital artifact, it only secures the right of ownership of the original copy of the digital artifact.
